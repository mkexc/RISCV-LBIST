# Logic BIST for RI5CY core

## Scripts:
- compile_testbench.sh : compiles all the required files to run the simulation of the core with LBIST
- compile_sbst.sh : compiles the firmware that will be used when the LBIST returns OK
- run_gate_gui.sh : runs the simulation of the core with LBIST. Launches a firmware if test is OK
- run_gate_nogui.sh : same as before but only in CLI
- run_syn.sh : synthesis of the standard core
- run_scan_insertion.sh : inserts scan chains and test points
- run_syn_bist.sh : synthesys of the final core wrapper which includes all the LBIST modules and the core quipped with DfT
- simulation.sh : compiles a simple testbench with only LFSR, PHASE SHIFTER and Core to compute the test patterns. Its VCD output has to be applied to Tmax for Fault Coverage evaluation.
- run_fsim.sh : executes fault simulation on patterns generated by the previous script. Both stuck-at fault and transition delay faults. In the end, it runs incremental ATPG.
- clean_all.sh : cleans all the work files
